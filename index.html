                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Carrie and I love helping my clients feel really good about themselves
                    with eyelash extensions and beautiful brows. I work in the centre of Totnes, in the
                    lovely Buddha Room of Bliss Hair Studio in Fore Street (down the small alleyway,
                    opposite The Mansion House). You’ll need to make an appointment as I’m not there
                    every day. I like to work in a calm, unhurried way so I invite my clients to lay back
                    and relax while I carefully apply your lashes as you listen to music or enjoy the
                    peace of the Buddha Room. </p>

                    <!-- <p>'Classic lashes'<br> are the simplest and suit most people. Lash extensions are available in different lengths and curls and are individually selected to sit comfortably and singly onto each natural lash. So for example, if you have short or straight lashes they can be extended into a fuller curl. <br><br>
                        ‘Volume lashes'<br> are made using very fine extensions formed into fans. The fans are still applied to individual lashes but create a softer fuller look.<br><br>
                        'Hybrid lashes'<br> are a combination of single lashes and fans. They suit most people giving the best of both options.<br><br>
                         Top-ups are needed within two to three weeks because our natural lashes have a six-week cycle of regrowth.</p> -->

                    <p><b>Long glossy lashes</b><br />
                        Lash extensions are a fantastic way of enhancing the natural beauty of your eyes,
                        whether it is for a special occasion, a treat for yourself, or a way to boost your
                        confidence. Not many of us are lucky enough to be born with long, glossy lashes
                        but with lash extensions, you can enjoy the look of full, sweeping lashes every day,
                        without the need for mascara. Once you’ve tried them, you might find your own
                        natural eyelashes feel just a little bit sparse and unappealing and lash extensions
                        may become a beauty treat you simply can’t live without.</p><br /><br />

                    <p> <b>Natural or exotic</b><br />

                        You can choose from natural shades of brown or black, or if you want a headturning
                        look you may want to select from my array of rainbow colours. Depending
                        what style you go for, your lash extensions can gently enhance your own lashes to
                        give you a sultry, natural look or they can transform your appearance with an
                        exotic, party look.<br /><br />

                <!-- <p>'Brow lamination' involves a gentle restructuring of the eyebrow hairs so that they can be brushed into a lighter expression. It is also helpful to tame unruly eyebrows! </p><br><br>
                    <p>'Lash lift' uses a similar technique of training lashes but into a curl. With a tint, they can really stand out. Suits longer lashes.</p><br><br>

        <div id="questions">
            <p><b>Here are some of the questions people most often ask me about lash extensions…</b></p>

            <p><b>Are you qualified and experienced?</b><br />
                Yes. I trained in Plymouth and have worked for six years offering lash extensions in
                Totnes.</p>

            <p><b>Will lash extensions damage my natural lashes?</b><br />This can happen if they are incorrectly
                applied. However, I take great care to apply
                lash extensions correctly to avoid damaging your natural lashes.</p>

            <p><b>Can I wear mascara with lash extensions?</b><br />If you want to but there’s really no need as your
                lashes will look long and full and
                luscious without any mascara.</p>

            <p><b>Can I have lash extensions if my natural eyelashes are very fine?</b><br />Yes. In fact you are the
                perfect candidate as your lashes will be beautifully
                enhanced by eyelash extensions.</p>

            <p><b>How long does it take?</b><br />I work in a careful, unhurried way as I believe this ensures the best
                possible finish
                and an opportunity for my clients to relax. I advise allowing a minimum of an hour
                and a half for a full set of lash extensions (two eyes).</p>

            <p><b>Do you just work with women?</b><br />No, I am happy to do lash extensions for anyone</p>

            <p><b>Can I swim with lash extensions?</b><br />Absolutely. They are ideal if you are going away on holiday
                and want to look good
                24/7. You can surf, ski, and sauna without the faff of reapplying mascara.</p>

            <p><b>How often will I need a top-up?</b><br />I advise having infills every two weeks to keep your lashes
                looking really good.
                Some clients choose to take a break from lash extensions every few months, but it
                is really up to you.
            </p>

            <p><b>Do you also offer brow treatments?</b><br />Yes. I offer brow lamination, dyeing, waxing and
                threading. Once you’ve seen how
                good your lashes can look you won’t want to neglect your brows.
            </p>

            <p><b>
                    Can I book any other beauty treatments with you?</b><br />For a truly indulgent treat, I offer
                facial massage. This will not only help you to
                feel good but it provides relaxation for the muscles of the face to help you look
                rejuvenated and refreshed.</p>

            <p><b>Do you offer gift vouchers, wedding packages or parties?</b><br />Yes. Please contact me to discuss
                your requirements.
                To book contact me on 07595 323090.</p>
